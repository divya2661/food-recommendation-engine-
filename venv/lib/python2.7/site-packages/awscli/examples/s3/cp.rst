**Copying a local file to S3**

The following ``cp`` command copies a single file to a specified
bucket and key::

    aws s3 cp test.txt s3://mybucket/test2.txt

Output::

    upload: test.txt to s3://mybucket/test2.txt


**Copying a file from S3 to S3**

The following ``cp`` command copies a single s3 object to a specified bucket and key::

    aws s3 cp s3://mybucket/test.txt s3://mybucket/test2.txt

Output::

    copy: s3://mybucket/test.txt to s3://mybucket/test2.txt


**Copying an S3 object to a local file**

The following ``cp`` command copies a single object to a specified file locally::

    aws s3 cp s3://mybucket/test.txt test2.txt

Output::

    download: s3://mybucket/test.txt to test2.txt


**Copying an S3 object from one bucket to another**

The following ``cp`` command copies a single object to a specified bucket while retaining its original name::

    aws s3 cp s3://mybucket/test.txt s3://mybucket2/

Output::

    copy: s3://mybucket/test.txt to s3://mybucket2/test.txt

**Recursively copying S3 objects to a local directory**

When passed with the parameter ``--recursive``, the following ``cp`` command recursively copies all objects under a
specified prefix and bucket to a specified directory.  In this example, the bucket ``mybucket`` has the objects
``test1.txt`` and ``test2.txt``::

    aws s3 cp s3://mybucket . --recursive

Output::

    download: s3://mybucket/test1.txt to test1.txt
    download: s3://mybucket/test2.txt to test2.txt

**Recursively copying local files to S3**

When passed with the parameter ``--recursive``, the following ``cp`` command recursively copies all files under a
specifed directory to a specified bucket and prefix while excluding some files by using an ``--exclude`` parameter.  In
this example, the directory ``myDir`` has the files ``test1.txt`` and ``test2.jpg``::

    aws s3 cp myDir s3://mybucket/ --recursive --exclude "*.jpg"

Output::

    upload: myDir/test1.txt to s3://mybucket2/test1.txt

**Recursively copying S3 objects to another bucket**

When passed with the parameter ``--recursive``, the following ``cp`` command recursively copies all objects under a
specifed bucket to another bucket while excluding some objects by using an ``--exclude`` parameter.  In this example,
the bucket ``mybucket`` has the objects ``test1.txt`` and ``another/test1.txt``::

    aws s3 cp s3://mybucket/ s3://mybucket2/ --recursive --exclude "mybucket/another/*"

Output::

    copy: s3://mybucket/test1.txt to s3://mybucket2/test1.txt

**Setting the Access Control List (ACL) while copying an S3 object**

The following ``cp`` command copies a single object to a specified bucket and key while setting the ACL to
``public-read-write``::

    aws s3 cp s3://mybucket/test.txt s3://mybucket/test2.txt --acl public-read-write

Output::

    copy: s3://mybucket/test.txt to s3://mybucket/test2.txt

**Granting permissions for an S3 object**

The following ``cp`` command illustrates the use of the ``--grants`` option to grant read access to all users and full
control to a specific user identified by their email address::

  aws s3 cp file.txt s3://mybucket/ --grants read=uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers full=emailaddress=user@example.com

Output::

    upload: file.txt to s3://mybucket/file.txt

**Uploading a local file stream to S3**

The following ``cp`` command uploads a local file stream from standard input to a specified bucket and key::

    aws s3 cp - s3://mybucket/stream.txt


**Downloading a S3 object as a local file stream**

The following ``cp`` command downloads a S3 object locally as a stream to standard output::

    aws s3 cp s3://mybucket/stream.txt -
