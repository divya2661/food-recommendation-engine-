"""
The GraphLab Create clustering toolkit provides tools for unsupervised learning
tasks, where the aim is to consolidate unlabeled data points into groups. Points
that are similar to each other should be assigned to the same group and points
that are different should be assigned to different groups.

The clustering toolkit contains two models: K-Means and DBSCAN.

Please see the documentation for each of these models for more details, as well
as the data science `Gallery <https://turi.com/learn/gallery>`_ and the
`clustering chapter of the User Guide
<https://turi.com/learn/userguide/clustering/intro.html>`_.
